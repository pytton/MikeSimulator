TODO:

1.Move callback function details from UserInterface and WidgetTable to Control.
Have UserInterface and WidgetTable call an appropriate function in the Control
class and have the control class handle all the details of what the function
does.

2.FirstIBAPI - create a new project based on the old one.
Move all the necessary files to one or two folders.
Clean up the mess that the current solution is.

3. Attach FirstIBAPI to MikeSimulator and add two buttons to MikeSimulator:
	one to connect to IB API
	second to pull and display in console bid/ask of SPY.

4.Change UserInterface so that it is created from Control class instead of
mikeSimulator. Create a new constructor taking Data and Control pointers instead
of mikesimulator pointers.
